## **Semantic enrichment demonstrator**
---
The notion of **multiple aspect trajectory** (MAT) has
been recently introduced in the literature to represent movement
data that is heavily semantically enriched with dimensions
(aspects) representing various types of semantic information (e.g.,
stops, moves, weather, traffic, events, and points of interest).
Aspects may be large in number, heterogeneous, or structurally
complex. Although there is a growing volume of literature
addressing the modelling and analysis of multiple aspect trajectories, 
the community suffers from a general lack of publicly
available datasets. This is due to privacy concerns that make it
difficult to publish such type of data, and to the lack of tools that
are capable of linking raw spatio-temporal data to different types
of semantic contextual data. With this demonstrator we want to show
that it is possible to devise a semantic enrichment processor that is able
to enrich trajectories with multiple aspects, and that it is able to
use of a variety of external data sources during such process.


### **Usage**

To use ```MAT-Builder``` with the graphical interface, run ```mat_builder.py```


### **Requirements**
---
To run MAT-Builder install requirements.

```pip install requirements.txt```
